# Evaluating-IBD-Flares-Predictors

This repository focuses on predicting disease flares in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using advanced statistical and machine learning technique such as G-LASSO regression analysis. The goal is to identify clinical baseline and non-clinical parameters that may signal an impending flare, allowing for early intervention and improved patient management.
Key Features 
✅ Data Processing & Feature Selection – Cleaning and preprocessing clinical datasets. 
✅ G-LASSO Regression for Predictive Modeling – Identifying critical predictive variables. 
✅ K-fold Cross validation & Performance Metrics – Ensuring robustness and accuracy. 
✅ Clinical Application – Contributing to precision medicine for IBD management.
This project aims to enhance flare prediction models, enabling personalized treatment strategies and better patient outcomes.
